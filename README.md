NOTE: Before copying any part of this code, please check with github author acjj0. 

Problem Statement: Detect and classify traffic signs

Methodology: Build, visualize and refine Convolutional Neural Networks

Technology:
Required: Tensorflow 2.x, Keras, Python, Jupyter,
Recommended: GPU, Kaggle (for downloading dataset)
Python Libs: sklearn, seaborn, pandas, math, numpy, cv2, itertools

Detail:
Understand problem space, autonomous driving use-cases, research papers, available datasets, technologies available
Analyze, prepare, visualize data set and design software
Build CNN model, evaluate, test, predict, visualize results
Results â€“ 98% test accuracy, 99.5% validation accuracy
Evaluate next steps with dataset, model, experiments, visualization, etc

Dataset: available on Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign. Login required for download.
Total size of zip is 612MB (although Kaggle shows as 300MB).

Note:
Used this dataset over other sources for both coding efficiency and opportunity to learn using dataframes to efficiently analyze image data instead of loading individual images.

Solution includes data visualization, model visualization at various layers, and hyperparameter tuning.
